Generate number of psets for (theoretically) any dimension and number of cards.

Depending on how you're running it, it might take quite a while or not work if the dimension/number of cards is too big.

Python is much easier to read, but C++ is far faster.
C++ version was rewritten with the help of a lot of googling and online tools, so it might read oddly.
