Generate number of psets for (theoretically) any dimension and number of cards.

Depending on how you're running it, it might take quite a while or not work if the dimension/number of cards is too big.
In an online compiler, I could run (5,6) and (5,7) in about a minute, (5,8) in about 3 minutes, and (5,9) in about 5.
